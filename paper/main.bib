abstract = "We introduce a notion of partial derivative of a regular expression and apply it to finite automaton constructions. The notion is a generalization of the known notion of word derivative due to Brzozowski: partial derivatives are related to non-deterministic finite automata (NFA's) in the same natural way as derivatives are related to deterministic ones (DFA's). We give a constructive definition of partial derivatives and prove several facts, in particular: 1. (1) any derivative of a regular expression r can be represented by a finite set of partial derivatives of r; 2. (2) the set of all partial derivatives of r is finite and its cardinality is less than or equal to one plus the number of occurrences of letters from A appearing in r; 3. (3) any partial derivative of r is either a regular unit, or a subterm of r, or a concatenation of several such subterms. These theoretical results lead us to a new algorithm for turning regular expressions into relatively small NFA's and allow us to provide certain improvements to Brzozowski's algorithm for constructing DFA's. We also report on a prototype implementation of our \{NFA\} construction and present several examples. "

This convention is known to cause considerable trouble in cases of substitution. In the present paper a different notational system is developed, where occurrences of variables are indicated by integers giving the “distance” to the binding λ instead of a name attached to that λ. The system is claimed to be efficient for automatic formula manipulation as well as for metalingual discussion. As an example the most essential part of a proof of the Church-Rosser theorem is presented in this namefree calculus."

abstract="Parsing is an important problem in computer science and yet surprisingly little attention has been devoted to its formal verification. In this paper, we present TRX: a parser interpreter formally developed in the proof assistant Coq, capable of producing formally correct parsers. We are using parsing expression grammars (PEGs), a formalism essentially representing recursive descent parsing, which we consider an attractive alternative to context-free grammars (CFGs). From this formalization we can extract a parser for an arbitrary PEG grammar with the warranty of total correctness, i.e., the resulting parser is terminating and correct with respect to its grammar and the semantics of PEGs; both properties formally proven in Coq.",

abstract = "Context-Free Grammars (CFGs) and Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs) have several similarities and a few differences in both their syntax and semantics, but they are usually presented through formalisms that hinder a proper comparison. In this paper we present a new formalism for CFGs that highlights the similarities and differences between them. The new formalism borrows from PEGs the use of parsing expressions and the recognition-based semantics. We show how one way of removing non-determinism from this formalism yields a formalism with the semantics of PEGs. We also prove, based on these new formalisms, how LL(1) grammars define the same language whether interpreted as CFGs or as PEGs, and also show how strong-LL(k), right-linear, and LL-regular grammars have simple language-preserving translations from CFGs to PEGs. Once these classes of CFGs can be automatically translated to equivalent PEGs, we can reuse classic top-down grammars in PEG-based tools."

PEGs are easy to use, and there are efficient implementations of PEG libraries in several programming languages. A frequently missed feature of PEGs is left recursion, which is commonly used in Context-Free Grammars (CFGs) to encode left-associative operations. We present a simple conservative extension to the semantics of PEGs that gives useful meaning to direct and indirect left-recursive rules, and show that our extensions make it easy to express left-recursive idioms from CFGs in PEGs, with similar results. We prove the conservativeness of these extensions, and also prove that they work with any left-recursive PEG. PEGs can also be compiled to programs in a low-level parsing machine. We present an extension to the semantics of the operations of this parsing machine that let it interpret left-recursive PEGs, and prove that this extension is correct with regard to our semantics for left-recursive PEGs."

abstract="We phrase parsing with context-free expressions as a type inhabitation problem where values are parse trees and types are context-free expressions. We first show how containment among context-free and regular expressions can be reduced to a reachability problem by using a canonical representation of states. The proofs-as-programs principle yields a computational interpretation of the reachability problem in terms of a coercion that transforms the parse tree for a context-free expression into a parse tree for a regular expression. It also yields a partial coercion from regular parse trees to context-free ones. The partial coercion from the trivial language of all words to a context-free expression corresponds to a predictive parser for the expression.",
